1. Install IIS (if not installed)
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

sh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-WebServer
Restart your computer.

2. Install IIS Node.js Module
Install iisnode to allow IIS to run Node.js apps:

Download from: https://github.com/Azure/iisnode

Install and restart IIS.
dont forget to install URL REwrite module too 
Put your folder in this path  C:\inetpub\wwwroot\

3. Configure IIS to Serve Your App
Move your project to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\chatproject

Open IIS Manager (inetmgr in Run).

Add a new site:

Site name: ChatApp

Physical path: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\chatproject

Port: the port you chose in your backend(make sure it doesn't have a parent process working on it)

Set Node.js as the backend:

Create a web.config in your project folder:
<configuration>
	<system.webServer>
		<handlers>
			<add name="iisnode" path="app.js" verb="*" modules="iisnode" />
		</handlers>
		<rewrite>
			<rules>
				<rule name="ChatApp">
					<match url="/*" />
					<action type="Rewrite" url="app.js" />
				</rule>
			</rules>
		</rewrite>
	</system.webServer>
</configuration>
Give Permissions to your folder :
In IIS Manager click on your server and open edit permissions (from the right panel)
Go to security  and click edit
Click add then advanced then find now
Find IIS_USERS and click ok and ok and give it full control(that is what i did)

Allow IIS to Access Node.js:
Open Windows Firewall and allow traffic for your app.(this can be really tricky so just ask AI to guide you throught it as it is really important)

Make sure no process is running on the port so it doesnt give an errors(kill process if not neccessary or change the port of both backend and IIS Server)

Maybe some errors are going to arrise that has something to do with the web configuration like locking elements just ask AI and it will have your solution
